    "# A more accurate integrator for HMC\n",

    "In this blog post we will learn more about integration schemes and discuss two different integrators:\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "Broadly speaking, the idea of HMC is that, given a previous state $x$ of our Markov chain, we draw a random momentum $v$ from a normal distribution and simulate the behaviour of a fictive particle with starting point $(x,v)$.\n",
    "This intuition makes sense, because our probability density gives rise to a potential energy and vice versa (see, for example, [Tweag's HMC blog post](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-08-06-mcmc-intro3/)).\n",
    "This deterministic behaviour is simulated for some fixed time $t$.\n",
    "The final state $(x^\\star, v^\\star)$ of the particle after the time $t$ will then serve as the new proposal state of a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of the fictive particle are governed by the Hamiltonian $$H(x,v) = K(v) + E(x).$$\n",
    "Technically, the Hamiltonian does not necessarily need to be of the form \"kinetic energy plus potential energy\", meaning \"separable\", but it is in the most popular HMC implementations and it makes things a lot easier.\n",
    "In fact, you can apply the splitting methods we discuss below to non-separable Hamiltonians as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the key concept of the HMC method is to simulate the fictive particle's dynamics.\n",
    "In terms of the Hamiltonian formalism, this is done by solving a set of differential equations, namely\n",

    "where $\\{\\cdot, \\cdot \\}$ is the [Poisson bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_bracket).\n",
    "The Poisson bracket is a differential operator of first order, which means that it uses first derivatives.\n",
    "It essentially describes the change of any observable quantity with respect to the time evolution of system evolving according to Hamilton's equations of motion.\n",
