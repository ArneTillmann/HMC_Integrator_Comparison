    "In this blog post we will compare the performance of two different integrators, sampling with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). In HMC, the classical Leapfrog is still the state of the art method to generate new proposal states for the Metropolis Hastings algorythm. In [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05308.pdf) Jun Hao Hue et al. benchmark the performance of the Leapfrog and U7, which was first presented by Thanh Tri Chau et al [2018 New J. Phys. 20 073003](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aacde1/pdf), against various classical and quantum systems, but not against sampling methods used in HMC.\n",
    "This blog post aims to give you first a brief introduction to HMC, then describes formally the two integrators and then numerically evaluates their performance. In case you are new to HMC or MCMC methods, a good starting point might be the [series of blog posts](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2019-10-25-mcmc-intro1/) by Simeon Carstens. "

    "Broadly speaking, the idea of HMC is, that given a previous state $x$ of our markov chain, we draw a random momentum $v$ from a normal distribution and simulate the behaviour of a fictive particle with starting point $(x,v)$. This intuition makes sense, because our probability density gives rise to a potential energy and vice versa \\fotenote Simeons_blog_post. This deterministic behaviour is simulated for some fixed time $t$. The final state $(x^\\star, v^\\star)$ of the particle after some time t will then serve as the new proposal state of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm."
